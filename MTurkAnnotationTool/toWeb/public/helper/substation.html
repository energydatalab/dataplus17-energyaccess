		<h3> Identification </h3>
		    <h4> What does a substation look like? </h4>
		    <p>
			Substations are an important part of the power grid.
			They step voltages up or down to the appropriate
			level and also act as switching stations. Some tips
			for spotting substations are:
			<ul>
			    <li>
				Look for closed-off areas with metal lattice structures inside.
			    </li>
			    <li>
				Look for power lines connecting to the complex.
			    </li>
		    </p>

		    <h4> Examples </h4>
		    <div class="example">
			<img class="example" src="img/substation1.png" alt="Substation"/>
			<br>
			<span class="example">
			    Note that there are no power lines connecting to
			    this substation. The area is fenced off and
			    consists of small structures supporting a
			    network of wires. Substations generally look
			    very similar to this.
			</span>
		    </div>
		    
		    <div class="example">
			<img class="example" src="img/substation2.png" alt="Substation"/>
			<br>
			<span class="example">
			    While the substation in this image is not as
			    easy to see, it is still easily identifiable.
			    Again, the area is fenced off. The wire network
			    in the substation is visible (barely). Note
			    the transmission lines connecting to the
			    substation from the left (the lines travel up
			    from the bottom of the image between the trees
			    and the parking lot) as well as the distribution
			    wires connecting on the right (these are 
			    indicated by the four shadows of power line
			    poles just to the right of the substation).
			</span>

                <h3> Frequently Asked Questions </h3>
                <ol>
		    <li> What parts of a substation should be annotated? </li>
		    <ul> Please draw a polygon around the whole complex.
			 This includes the empty space enclosed within the
			 outer fence, but not connecting power lines.
		    </ul>
                </ol>
