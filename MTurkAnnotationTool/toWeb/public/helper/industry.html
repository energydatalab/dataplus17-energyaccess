		<h3> Identification </h3>
		    <h4> What do industrial complexes look like? </h4>
		    <p>
			Industrial complexes have a great variety in their
			appearance. We are trusting you to recognize them â€“
			if you believe something is an industrial complex,
			then label it as one. Since appearance can vary
			wildly between two complexes, it is hard to give
			tips that apply for every or almost every industrial
			complex. Here are some that hopefully help you:
			<ul>
			    <li>
				Look for large areas with many large buildings or structures inside.
			    </li>
			    <li>
				Look for steam or smoke emissions.
			    </li>
			    <li>
				Some industrial complexes have railroad
				extensions connecting to them. 
			    </li>
		    </p>

		    <h4> Examples </h4>
		    <div class="example">
			<img class="example" src="img/industry1.png" alt="Industrial complex"/>
			<br>
			<span class="example">
			    This extremely large complex consists of many
			    buildings, storage tanks, and other structures. 
			    Near the center of the image is a structure
			    emitting steam, and just above that is a 
			    railroad track bisecting the complex.
			</span>
		    </div>
		    
		    <div class="example">
			<img class="example" src="img/industry2.png" alt="Industrial complex"/>
			<br>
			<span class="example">
			    This industrial complex consists of a very large
			    building with a few smaller structure located 
			    near the top of the complex. Note the shipping
			    trailers at the top left and the storage tanks
			    located around the facility.
			</span>

                <h3> Frequently Asked Questions </h3>
                <ol>
		    <li> What parts of an industrial complex should be annotated? </li>
		    <ul> Please draw a polygon around the whole complex.
			 This includes parking areas and similar open areas
			 on the complex.
		    </ul>
		    <li> What if an industrial complex is located on the edge of the image?
		    <ul> Draw a polygon around the parts you can see.
		    </ul>
                </ol>
