README FILE FOR GIS LAYER 
Kar-village-with census 1991 and 2001-GEOG

1.  This is a shapefile containing the revenue village boundaries of villages in Karnataka 
state, India
2.  The boundaries have been digitized manually from District Census Handbooks of 
Census 1991. Each taluka (=CD block in Karnataka) had a separate map. Each map 
was scanned and digitzed by hand. Each taluka file was geo-rectified using 
corresponding taluka boundaries created from Survey of India toposheets.
3.  The fit of Census maps with Survey of India maps is not great. So the spatial 
registration error is +/- 500m.
4.  Digitization was verified by comparing area of the digitized polygons with areas as 
given in the Census database. However, in several cases, even though there was no 
visible digitization error, the areas did not match.
5.  Multi-part villages were identified and converted into multi-part polygons where 
possible.
6.  The layer has been reprojected to WGS84 datum and Geographic projection (units: 
decimal degrees)
7.  The village polygons were coded with 1991 and 2001 census location codes. But the 
layer does not reflect 2001 boundaries accurately (where villages have been merged 
into towns or part-merged into towns.)
