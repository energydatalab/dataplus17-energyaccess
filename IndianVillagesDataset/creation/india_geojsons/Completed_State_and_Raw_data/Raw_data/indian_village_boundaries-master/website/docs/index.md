description: A project website for Indian village boundary maps in geojson format for download and reuse. 

#Indian Village Boundaries (Maps)

Indian Village boundaries sourced from different government websites which are freely available to all the Indians. Here we have digitized them, cleaned them, added appropriate attributes so it can be used by all the researchers, students etc

The boundaries are organized by state using state ISO code. All the village boundaries are available in geojson (WGS84, EPSG4326) format. The below table gives you the status of the data as we clean and upload. Data is not perfect there as many errors both in data and boundaries. You can contribute by sending the pull requests. Please use the census names when correcting the attributes and geojson for shapes. Refer [CONTRIBUTING](/contributing) for ways to contribute.

## Structure
Each state has a folder with a short name, for example state of Karnataka will have folder called <code>ka</code> folder. It will contain 

- A geojson file <code>ka.json</code> which is our map file
- A <code>ka.csv</code> is a <code>,</code> delimted file to match the 2001 census codes to 2011 census codes and other attributes


### GeoJson Attributes
Each boundary will have the following attributes

* NAME : Name of the Village/Town as per census 2001
* TYPE: Village or Town 
* SUB_DIST: Sub District name as per census 2001
* DISTRICT : District name as per census 2001
* STATE: State or UT name as per census 2001
* CEN_2001: Code as per 2001 census, its a concatination of State Code, District Code, Sub-District Code, Village Code 2001.

### CSV Attributes

* village_code_2011
* village_name_2011
* state_code_2011
* district_code_2011 
* sub_district_code_2011
* village_code_2001
* village_name_2001
* state_code_2001
* district_code_2001
* sub_district_code_2001
* CEN_2001 : Code as per 2001 census, its a concatination of State Code, District Code, Sub-District Code, Village Code 2001. This can be used as the key to match the polygon in geojson
